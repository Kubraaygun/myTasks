# Task Management App

The Task Management App is a mobile application that allows users to track their tasks. Users can create, update, delete tasks, and change the status of tasks (Ongoing, Pending, Completed, Canceled). Additionally, tasks can be categorized, and start and end dates can be specified for each task.
